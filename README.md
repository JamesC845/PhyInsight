# PhyInsight: Providing Efficient Phylogenetic Insights

Welcome to PhyInsight, a tool for showing phylogenetic insights through
automatic DNA string manipulation.

 

## What PhyInsight Can Do

PhyInsight has functions that:

- retrieve specimen data and organises it into an easy-to-use dataframe

- automatically process DNA strings preparing them for analysis

- filter out mismatched sequences

- detect and remove outlier sequences

- create, plot, and save phylogenetic trees

 

## Installation

You can install PhyInsight 0.1.0 from GitHub by using the following
command:

``` r
remotes::install_github("JamesC845/PhyInsight")
```

 

## Upcoming Updates

- functions for automatic phylogenetic tree inference

- functions will be added and/or existing functions will be updated so
  that PhyInsight will be compatible with more databases

# DivInsight: Providing Ecological Insights from Historical Occurrence Data

Welcome to DivInsight, a tool for unlocking valuable ecological insights from historical occurrence data. This R package is designed to help researchers by providing powerful methods for ecological desk studies.

&nbsp;

## What DivInsight Can Do

DivInsight takes datasets of taxon occurrences and enables you to:

- generate diversity index values for given locations
- understand species abundance and diversity changes over time
- create species composition matrices which can be used in other analyses
- query environmental data alongside diversity index values
- calculate and visualise taxon range

Please check the articles tab at the top of this page to see these analyses in action!

&nbsp;

## Installation

You can install DivInsight 0.1.0 from CRAN by using the following command:

``` r
install.packages("DivInsight")
```

Until the newest version has been accepted by CRAN, DivInsight 1.2.0 can be downloaded from GitHub using the following command:

``` r
remotes::install_github("JamesC845/DivInsight")
```


&nbsp;

## Upcoming Updates

- DivInsight currently uses functions compatible with datasets queried from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) regarding occurrence data, as well as datasets queried the Storm Glass datagrid (www.stormglass.io) regarding environmental data. In the future, other data sources will be explored in order to improve the validity of results provided by this package.

- Given the laborious process of querying large datasets from GBIF using R, a vignette tutorial will be provided to show users the most efficient way to do so. This will be especially helpful for users unfamiliar with the `rgbif` package.

- Various utility functions will be added to make scripts more efficient.
